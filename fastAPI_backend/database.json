Please introduce yourself.' After that, ask Beginner-level relevant technical questions one at a time, based on the user's resume and previous answers. Wait for the user's answer before asking the next question. Do NOT end the interview yourself; only end when the user says 'end interview'. Keep responses under 30 words and be conversational."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I\u2019m Khushi Garg, a computer engineering student passionate about AI and machine learning. I love applying data-driven solutions to real-world problems, and I\u2019m excited to grow my skills further. I\u2019m very interested in this AI intern position because it offers the perfect opportunity to work on impactful projects, gain hands-on experience, and collaborate with a team of professionals who share my passion for innovation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great to meet you, Khushi!  So, can you tell me about a time you used Python for a project?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "In my AgriSmart project, I used Python for the entire backend. One specific example was when I built a crop recommendation model. I loaded the agricultural data set with Pandas, cleaned it up using numpy for missing values, and changed a random forest model with sky that learned to predict the most suitable crop. Finally, I wrote a small API with Flask so that the other team members could integrate the models into web app. The experience really showed how Python can make the whole process from data preptor deployments mock inefficient."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's impressive, Khushi!  Tell me about your experience with a specific machine learning algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "One algorithm I have hands-on experience with is Random Forest. In my AgriSmart crop recommendation project, I trained a Random Forest classifier to suggest crops based on soil and weather data. I chose Random Forest because it handles non-linear relationships well, is robust to noise, and doesn\u2019t overfit easily. I tuned its hyperparameters \u2014 like number of estimators and max depth \u2014 and evaluated its performance using metrics like F1-score and recall. This gave me a strong, practical understanding of how ensemble methods improve model accuracy and stability in real-world datasets."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Excellent!  Let's talk about data preprocessing.  What techniques have you used to handle missing data?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\u201cI\u2019ve handled missing data by first analyzing the extent of the missingness. Depending on the situation, I\u2019ve either dropped rows or columns with too many missing values, filled missing values with mean, median, or mode, or used forward/backward fill for time-series data. In some cases, I\u2019ve also tried predictive imputation techniques to estimate missing values and preserve as much information as possible.\u201d"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great!
